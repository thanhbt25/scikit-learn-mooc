Select a single answer --> choose b

Question

Assuming that we have a dataset with little noise, a model is underfitting when:

a) both the train and test errors are high

b) train error is low but test error is high

c) train error is high but the test error is low

d) both train and test errors are low

Question

For a fixed training set, by sequentially adding parameters to give more flexibility to the model, we are more likely to observe:

a) a wider difference between train and test errors

b) a reduction in the difference between train and test errors

c) an increased or steady train error

d) a decrease in the train error

Select all answers that apply --> choose d, a 

Question

For a fixed choice of model parameters, if we increase the number of labeled observations in the training set, are we more likely to observe:

a) a wider difference between train and test errors

b) a reduction in the difference between train and test errors

c) an increased or steady train error

d) a decrease in the train error

Select all answers that apply --> choose c, b 

Question

Polynomial models with a high degree parameter:

a) always have the best test error (but can be slow to train)

b) underfit more than linear regression models

c) get lower training error than lower degree polynomial models

d) are more likely to overfit than lower degree polynomial models

Select all answers that apply --> choose d 

Question

If we chose the parameters of a model to get the best overfitting/underfitting tradeoff, we will always get a zero test error.

a) True

b) False

Select a single answer --> choose b
